# pandas-challenge - Data Analysis and Visualization Course
# CSV to Python ETL Pandas
# Function
Convert CSV into data frames to then analyze different statistics within schools in a certain district. There are several different summaries that were created to find what types of schools and in which district had better scores based on spending and other factors. The final result was that spending didnâ€™t necessarily result in higher test scores, but charter schools had a much higher passing rate than public schools. 
# Organization
Each data frame shows different statistics. You can view these data frames in the images folder. 
# How to Run
Go to Jupiter notebook and run each frame of code to produce the results. This should work with updating data.
